## Markdown

   The first innovation that I have discovered for myself is that you need to use **markdown** formatting to edit text, and what's even funnier is that you need to style everything ***with your own hands***, without using pre-prepared buttons.

   From the very beginning, everything was difficult and unusual, but after sitting and studying the information for two days I can say, that this is not such a difficult topic for me. Now I'm going to show you (and remind myself) some commands, each of which fulfills different functions.

- For examle you can stylized your own header:
   
   | Symbol | Heading text |
   | :--- | :---: |
   | `#` | Like `h1` header |
   | `###` | Like `h3` header |
   
   - and etc., when end at six `#` symblols
