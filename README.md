In this repository I will write about the work with which I dealt and I will write reports on the lessons I have learned, so have fun (smile)

## Markdown

   The first innovation that I have discovered for myself is that you need to use **markdown** formatting to edit text, and what's even funnier is that you need to style everything ***with your own hands***, without using pre-prepared buttons.

1. From the very beginning, everything was difficult and unusual, but after sitting and studying the information for two days I can say, that this is not such a difficult topic for me. Now I'm going to show you (and remind myself) some commands, each of which fulfills different functions.

- For examle you can stylized your own **header**:
   
   | Symbol | Heading text |
   | :--- | :---: |
   | `#` | Like `h1` header |
   | `###` | Like `h3` header |
   
   - and etc., when end at six `#` symblols

2. To your attantion I want to present command with which you're be able to use ordered/unordered **lists**. Above you can see example unordered lists. But from below will already be presented commands for created list:

```
- Kottans
- Front-end
- Course
```

```

2. is a distributed
3. version-control system

3. Okay, let's move. Further I was shoked by creating **table**. Not the table itself, no no :grin:, specifically ***table creation***, I'll show you now:

   ```
   | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Python |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |
   ```

   | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Python |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | :x: |

   - The table shows the markup and program languages which I use/not use

***IN CONCLUSION***: Yeah, generally markdown it's basic, but in all that's information was new for me. I spent some of my time on learning, because of that I should to write about it here. On the whole, finishing. In notes I described just a little part of all, that I had to find out, not to mention stylized text (by the way, which I'm using), about code blocks (which I use too ! ), emogi, [design elements](https://shields.io/) and few different items.
